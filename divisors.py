'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

def divisor(number):
    range_of_numbers = int(input('Enter range of numbers to test divisibility: '))
    print("According to the range 1 - {}, {} can only be divided by: ".format(range_of_numbers, number))
    for i in range(1,range_of_numbers):
        if number % i == 0:
            print(i)
