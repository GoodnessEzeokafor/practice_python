This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates)
'''
import random

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = random.sample((1,30), 12)
    b = random.sample((1,30), 16)
    new_list = [i for i in set(a)if i in b]
    print(new_list)
